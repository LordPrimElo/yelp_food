Yelp_Food

This is basically a project to show off on my portfolio.
It is a yelp-like website but instead of general buisnesses, it focuses only on food reviews.

It has the functionality of viewing, adding, deleting and modifying existing food reviews.

It uses several NPM packages (Check out package.json if interest), JS, EJS, CSS, ExpressJS and NodeJS.

It also uses MongoDB as its database, and uses passportJS for authentication and authorisation.

You can clone it if you want, however you need to credit me and Dr. Josh Bastean.
